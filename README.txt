These resources where made without any extra roleplay frameworks, however NativeUI was used to create the menus, and "https://github.com/EthanPeacock/progressBars/tree/1.0"
was used to create the progress bar.

These are not all full resources as I wanted to get more experience over a larger amount of areas of fivem dev work rather than making 1 really focused resource and not gain
knowledge of other areas.
